### Disclaimer

The html file does not contain any Javascript files; it is purely static. This only displays a list of items that I got from their APIs endpoint, which I found from the site's source code. You can also find them by manually typing an id as follow: https://cg.originmood.com/shop-item.html?id=[type id]. 

These items may or may not be accurate or even included in the final version. 

It's actually very simple to find things in their source code. I had been playing around since the start of the web event, but unfortunately, I could not find any exploits x). I can tell you where to look if you find me on discord XD.
